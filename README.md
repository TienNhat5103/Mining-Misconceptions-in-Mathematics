# Eedi---Mining-Misconceptions-in-Mathematics
The Kaggle competition titled "Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics" challenges participants to develop machine learning models that predict the affinity between student misconceptions and incorrect answers (distractors) in multiple-choice mathematics questions  
In this competition, I had create a pipeline (explained clearly in the notebook) for data preprocessing, feature engineering,model training and reference to predict misconceptions in multiple-choice questions.
